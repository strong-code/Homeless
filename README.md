#Homeless

##What Is It?

A re-write of [CLPadFinder](https://github.com/clindsay107/CLPadFinder) but using node.js instead of Python. The idea is to allow people to set up email alerts for new apartment or housing listings in their area. 

##Why?

Because I wanted to learn node, and the original version is a piece of shit that hardly works. Plus I want to give this a nice web interface and practice my design skills.

##Requirements

Node.js and Express as well as parse-rss via npm (I need to make a package.json file at some point if the requires ever grow bigger, for now just deal with it you nerds)

Hopefully I will have a demo up and running on Heroku once the backend is finished.
